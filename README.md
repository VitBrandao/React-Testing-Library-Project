### React Testing Library - Pokedéx Tests

This is a project that I developed in December/2021. 

The challenge was about coding the **test coverage** for an application (SPA) created with fetching data from [Poké API](https://pokeapi.co/). 

You will find **all my tests** at **src/tests** folder in this Repository. Each file refers to a single page from the website, including the '404 Not Found' page. 

The application itself was already developed by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/) so the students could focus only in **RTL**.
